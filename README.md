## To Do

- [ ] Auto generate library version based on [Semantic Versioning][semver]
- [ ] Better namespace organizations (move core functions to their own namespaces)
- [ ] Add better Clojure Docs
- [x] Configure clj-kondo to not throw errors to some forms (e.g. nubank matcher-combinators `match?`)
